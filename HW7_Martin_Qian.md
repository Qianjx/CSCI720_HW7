1. ( 1 ) When you have clustered to six clusters, report the size of each cluster, from lowest to highest. 
115 121 131 140 161 181 

2. ( 1 ) When you have clustered to six clusters, report the average prototype of these six clusters.

3. ( 1 ) What typifies each of the six clusters?  What name should we give each of these prototypes? 

6. ( 5 ) Write a conclusion about what you learned overall.   If each of you learned different things, tell me what each of you learned.
